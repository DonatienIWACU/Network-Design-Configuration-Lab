Network Design & Configuration Lab

I designed and configured a small network with VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, static routing, and trunking. A point-to-point router link was implemented, and full connectivity across 8 PCs was verified.


Protocols & Technologies Used
VLANs (802.1Q): Logical segmentation of departments


Trunking: Router-on-a-stick for multi-VLAN traffic


Inter-VLAN Routing: Enabled communication between VLANs


Static Routing: Established connectivity between two routers


ICMP: Verified end-to-end connectivity with ping tests


Subinterfaces & /30 Link: Managed VLAN traffic and router-to-router link


Accomplishments
Created VLANs to logically separate departments


Configured router-on-a-stick using 802.1Q trunking


Enabled routing between VLANs (Inter-VLAN Routing)


Built a point-to-point routed link between two routers


Successfully tested and verified connectivity across all devices


The Technical architecture, configuration process, and test results (ping) are included below on other files.
