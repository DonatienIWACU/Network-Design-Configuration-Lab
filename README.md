# Network-Design-Configuration-Lab
Designed and implemented a small-scale network in Cisco Packet Tracer featuring VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, static routing, and trunking. Configured a router-on-a-stick setup, established a point-to-point router link, and verified full connectivity across 8 PCs using ICMP.
